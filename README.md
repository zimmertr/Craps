#Craps Game

Craps is a dice game where a user starts with 10 credits. A player rolls the dice over and over until they either win or lose. A player begins a turn by rolling two dice, which is called `coming out`. The player will win 1 credit if the come out is a 7 or 11. But the player will lose 1 credit if the come out is 2, 3, or 12. Otherwise, the `point` is set to the value of the `come out` roll. The player continue to roll until the point is rolled a second time (Awarding the player another credit) or a 7 is rolled (The player loses a credit). A new turn is started when the player runs out of credits or chooses to start a new game.
